sxiv loop patch


Summary

This patch allows you to "loop" when moving the cursor in sxiv.
sxiv is available here: https://github.com/muennich/sxiv
For example, if your cursor is positioned on the last image in the thumbnail
view, moving it to the right will take you back to the first image.


Features

Things that loop:

- Thumbnail selection (both vertically and horizontally) in thumbnail mode
- Image navigation in image mode
- Navigating through frames of animation while viewing an animated image
- Navigating through marked images

Things that don't loop:
- Zoom controls
- Gamma controls

Other changes:
- The mouse cursor changes to an arrow for image mode navigation even if you are
	pointing to the left of the first image or to the right of the last
	image.


How to install

Please see the "Notes" section at the bottom of this file for more information.

Patch the relevant files in the sxiv source using patch(1).

For example, to patch main.c, you would type something like:

patch sxiv/main.c sxiv-loop-patch/main.c.diff

...assuming that the sxiv source is located in ./sxiv and the patch files are
located in ./sxiv-loop-patch .

The diff files where generated using GNU diff so if you're having problems,
you may want to use GNU patch or make the changes manually.

Notes

This patch was made for sxiv commit
1d28627868f5133a25a0197af21a187799ffa98e (Stable version 26)
and will likely not be maintained. If you are using a later version and the
patch doesn't work, I cannot guarantee that I'll help you. In the case where I
don't, you'll have to look at the code and figure it out yourself.
